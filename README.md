# Environmental-Impact-Assessment
Impact of developmental projects on environment has been studied, comapred & insighted with the help of case studies, specifically two power projects 
and a river diversion project rooted in-and-around the Western Ghats have been taken into consideration. Power plant projects 
exert multi-facet impact on the ecology. In case of thermal power project it directly influence the environment through effluents, 
whereas small hydro power project may stimulate the scarcity of environmental flow to the downstream uses in addition to the 
existing inundation problem. The environmental flow allocation is still the bottle neck for one of the hot concerns of Dakshina 
Kannada district being the Yettinahole project. Care must be taken to implement economically viable developmental projects 
with high dependability which may run for a longer been.
